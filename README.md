# AVFoundationEditor

#### NOTE: This app does not run on iOS 7.  A new and improved iOS 7-compatible version will be released as part of my <a href="http://www.bobmccune.com/2013/11/08/learning-av-foundation-book-in-development/">Learning AV Foundation</a> book that currently under development.

This is the companion app to Bob McCune's "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bobmccune/composing-and-editing-media-with-av-foundation">Composing and Editing Media with AV Foundation</a>" presentation at CocoaConf.

The demo app is a simple video editing application patterned after iMovie for iOS.  Here's a quick description of its features:

### Composition ###
Audio and video clips can be arranged along a timeline.  This demostrates using AVComposition to build simple and complex temporal arrangements of AVAssets.

A user can select video clips from the media picker and arrange them along the timeline.  Basic drag and drop is implemented to allow for reordering of clips and an individual clip's duration can be trimmed.

The app also allows adding audio tracks to the composition.  Limited DnD support is provided to move the voiceover track within the overall timeline.

### Audio Mixing ###
Audio fades and ducking can be enabled from the settings menu.  This demonstrates using AVAudioMix to apply fades and ducking to the soundtrack.

### Video Transitions ###
Video transitions can be enabled from the settings menu.  This demonstrates how to use AVVideoComposition to create simple transition effects such as cross disolves and push transitions.

### Layering Content ###
Animated titles can be enabled from the settings menu.  This demonstrates how to AVSynchronizedLayer to provide animated layering effects such as titling.
